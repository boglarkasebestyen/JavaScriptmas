## What is JavaScriptmas?ðŸŽ„

 JavaScriptmas is a 24-day long, daily coding challenge organized by the Norwegian online coding school, [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), starting from December 1st until December 24th, 2020.  It strictly consists of JavaScript exercises, as its name suggests.

In this repository I committed all my solutions to the exercises.

Scrimba's Advent Calendar with the exercises can be found [here](scrimba.com/learn/adventcalendar).

## Day 5 - Reverse a String
Reverse the provided string. You may need to turn the string into an array before you reverse it. Your result must be a string.

).


## Day 6 - Sort by Length
Given an array of strings, sort them in the order of increasing lengths.
If two strings have them same length, their relative order must be the same as in the initial array.

).


## Day 7 - Count Vowel Consonant
You are given a string s that consist of only lowercase English letters.
If vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') are given a value of 1 and consonants are given a value of 2, return the sum of all of the letters in the input string.

## Day 8 - Rolling Dice
In this challenge a casino has asked you to make an online dice that works just like it would in real life. Using the pre-made dice face that represents â€˜oneâ€™, make the faces for â€˜twoâ€™, â€˜threeâ€™, â€˜fourâ€™, â€˜fiveâ€™ and â€˜sixâ€™. Now, when the users click the dice on the screen, the dice is expected to show one of the faces randomly.

## Day 9 - Sum Odd Fibonacci
Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num. The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1,1,2,3,5 and 8.

## Day 11 - Avoid Obstacles
You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line. Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. Ypu are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer. Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

).


## Day 18 - Array previous less
Given an array of integers, for each position i, search among the previous positions for the last (from the left) position
that contains a smaller value. Store that value at position i in the answer. If no such value can be found, store -1 instead.
